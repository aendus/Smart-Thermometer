# Smart-Thermometer
Temperature and Humidity Sensor with Web Interface!

During my internship at FabLab Bern, I had the unique opportunity to realize a project of my choice: a self-built temperature and humidity sensor that displays real-time data on a locally hosted website.

I used an ESP8266 as the "brain" and an AM2302 sensor to measure humidity and temperature. With these two components and a bit of code, I built a functioning smart thermometer. To read the temperature, you simply need to enter the IP address of the ESP8266 in a web browser, and you can immediately see the temperature.

My favorite feature is that my smart thermometer can display the data from the past 24 hours in a clear graph.

FabLab Bern provided the perfect environment to bring this idea to life. With access to modern tools and machines like 3D printers and laser cutters, along with exchanges with other creative minds, I was able to not only assemble my hardware but also significantly expand my knowledge in areas such as electronics, 3D printing, and 3D design.

During my two weeks at FabLab Bern, I made great progress in 3D modeling, printing, programming, and prototyping. An important lesson I learned was to test small details first before printing the entire product. This can also be applied to programming: working on individual features one at a time leads to better results than tackling everything at once.

Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time during the two weeks to create a simple integration of the thermometer into Home Assistant, an open-source smart home platform. However, I still plan to do that.
